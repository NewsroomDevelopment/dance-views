For artists, this period was especially difficult, as much of their daily routine revolved around creating art for others’ enjoyment. Dancers, specifically, had to quickly adapt their classes and performances to the virtual world, minimizing their once expansive movements to fit within a Zoom frame. For some, freedom from the mirrored studio allowed for greater self-acceptance and further investment into movement. For others, being given the space to take a step back from consistent training gave them new opportunities."

My mind was full of ideas, but my mouth felt too slow to articulate them, leaving me grasping for words that were no longer there. Sentences were ejected from my mouth like word vomit, racing to escape from the clutches of my mind and to desperately talk themselves into fruition.

As I grew older, I came to realize that my legs were too hypoextended—naturally bent in the wrong way—my arches too flat, my torso too short, my hips too wide. The list went on and on. While daily dance class allowed for an escape from the outside world, I only felt more trapped within the comparative standards that I set for myself."

I loved it. It was my escape from reality; whether it was after a long day of school or simply when I woke up in the morning, I always looked forward to taking a dance class to clear the thoughts that plagued my mind. So as I sit here, looking back at how the pandemic affected my relationship with dance, I cannot help but wonder: When and why did that change? When did dance—once my escape—suddenly become the very thing I sought to escape?"

Though I had taken advantage of these opportunities in the first month of quarantine, I had little desire to take those classes now. My heart just was not in it. Instead of being an extension of myself, dance began to feel like a chore. I would wake up in the morning and commit to taking a late afternoon ballet class only to spend my whole day dreading to see 5:30 p.m. on the clock. Once in class, things were fine, but that was it: It was <i>just</i> fine. The comfort and release class once gave me was no longer there; it was now replaced with stress and anxiety. In spite of this, I did not let myself succumb to the nagging feeling in my stomach, for I was determined not to throw away my lifelong passion. I thought I was doing the right thing by forcing myself to fight through what I thought was just a rough patch, but it turned out to be a bit more than just a rut."

I did not understand why, and it was terrifying, isolating, and disappointing. In all honesty, it felt like I was letting myself—or rather, the 10-year-old version of myself who desperately wanted to be noticed by dance teachers and “make it” in the dance world—down. I continued to force myself to take classes, hoping the valley in which I found myself stuck would eventually rise again to a peak. Instead, not only did I remain in that valley, but by forcing myself to continue dancing, it became clearer how much of a mental toll trying to escape the rut was taking on me. I was so afraid of becoming a burned-out college kid that I was willing to do just about anything to avoid it. So, I took the advice of those around me and decided to take a break."

I became frustrated once more, but this time, I decided to actually face my problem head-on. At this point, it was a few months into the pandemic and I had grown more accustomed to the slowed pace the world now followed. My comfort with the new state of things empowered me to sit with my thoughts and think rationally about my dance future. Turns out, those very thoughts that had terrified me at the start of the pandemic would actually provide some answers."

In reality, it would be impossible for me to be the dancer I used to be considering that I no longer spend hours in the studio each day. I could no longer make decisions based solely on how to improve my dancing. The pandemic helped me break down this fictitious notion I had in my head that somehow my sense of worth was tied to dance––that I could not be a good person, or <i>a </i>person for that matter, if I was not a good dancer."

I developed tunnel vision from constantly moving at such a high speed that I could not understand my relationship with dance beyond the binary division of fully dedicating myself to it or giving it up altogether. The pandemic and the sense of slowed time it brought opened my eyes: I can still love something and, at the same time, no longer have a desire to pursue it as a career."

I was so afraid to admit that my sense of self no longer depended on dance that I forced myself to believe that I did not like dance anymore. In reality, my love for dance never faltered. If anything, it grew, and I now have an even healthier relationship with dance because it is <i>only </i>my love for it that fuels my training, watching, and performing. There is no external pressure to achieve a specific goal because I am simply dancing just to dance."

It becomes an identifier, a mindset, a personality, an inseparable extension of oneself. To that end, I think I will always <i>be </i>a dancer, even though it is no longer my defining trait. When you dedicate over 14 years to something as physically and mentally taxing and as rewarding as dance, it becomes nearly impossible to extinguish all the habits you picked up. As I crack my hips the first thing in the morning, listen to music and naturally sway along while counting in eights, get antsy after sitting still for too long, and have a ridiculously high pain tolerance due to my years of pointe training, I recognize that there are certain characteristics forever ingrained into my head and my body."
